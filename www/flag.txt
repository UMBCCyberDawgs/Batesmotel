CONGRADULATIONS!
You've completed the challenge, the flag is:
alfred_hitchcock_is_the_best

I have one more challenge for you however, which is to try and get Norman
Bates' (plaintext) password.

Do you think you can do that?

Hint: Some files may be too long to see in this page... maybe there is another way to see everything that renders this page?

Challenge: how can you get a shell here?
